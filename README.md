# Nobero Scraper Project

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping product data from the Nobero website and providing a backend API and frontend UI for displaying the data. The primary focus was on scraping the data using Scrapy.

## Project Structure

- **nobero_scraper/**: Contains the Scrapy project and spider code.
- **products.json**: The file where the scraped data is stored.

## Scraping Data

The data was scraped using a Scrapy spider. Due to time constraints, the scraping was completed as part of an assessment. The data is available in the `products.json` file located inside the `nobero_scraper` folder.

## Running the Scraper

To run the Scrapy spider, ensure you are in the root directory of the Scrapy project and execute:

```bash
scrapy crawl nobero
```
Make sure that the scrapy.cfg file is present in the directory. This file is required for running Scrapy commands.

## Future Work

Although the scraping was completed for this assessment, I was unable to finish the entire project before the deadline. I spent most of my time learning Scrapy and implementing it for the assessment.

However, I am capable of:

Building the UI using React.JS.
Developing the backend using either Spring Boot or NodeJS or Django.
If given more time, I can complete the frontend and backend components to provide a fully functional application.
